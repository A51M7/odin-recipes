    <h2>Pasta salad recipe</h2>
    <p>This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta. Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, if you want to go the extra mile, make your own at home. Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor. Youâ€™ll need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), and a can of black olives. </p>

<p>Pasta salad, known in Italian as insalata di pasta or pasta fredda, is a salad dish prepared with one or more types of pasta, almost always chilled or room temperature, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or mayonnaise-based dressing. It is typically served as an appetiser (antipasto) or first course (primo). Pasta salad is often regarded as a spring or summertime dish, but it can be served any time of year.</p>
