        <h2>Lasagna Recipe</h2>

        <p>This is actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna before," according to jimbob2229. "I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again." 
            "I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient, but it was great with just the beef," says one Allrecipes community member. "The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in jars."
            "I made this recipe last night and it turned out fabulous," raves Daniel Steed. "I did increase the meats and sauce a little for the slightly larger pan size, but everyone loved it. I served it with garlic toast and green beans for a side."</p>
        
            <p>Allow the homemade lasagna to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the oven or in the microwave.

                If you plan to freeze lasagna, it's best to bake it in a foil pan. Allow it to cool completely, then tightly wrap the entire dish in storage wrap. Next, wrap it in at least one tight layer of aluminum foil. 
                Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the oven or microwave.</p>
