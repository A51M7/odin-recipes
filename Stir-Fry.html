    <h2>Chicken Stir-Fry Recipe</h2>

    <p>This chicken stir-fry recipe is packed with veggies and is quick and easy to prepare. Try adding bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, snap peas, 
    or any of your favorite vegetables. Serve it with white or brown rice, or noodles. Chicken stir fry is a dish made by quickly cooking chicken and vegetables together in a wok over high heat while constantly stirring. The cooking technique, known as stir frying, originated in China and is similar to the French technique of sautéing.
    The origins of stir frying can be traced back to China, where it originated as a way to cook food quickly and efficiently using limited fuel. The technique is believed to have originated during the Ming dynasty, around 1,500 years ago. </p>

    <p>To begin with, a stir fry should involve an extremely hot pan — traditionally and for best results a wok, (although we’ll talk more on that in a moment) — a splash of high-smoke point oil and should be served right away.

        One of the main selling points of stir fry is that, by cooking so hot and quick, it scorches out ingredients’ natural aromas and brightens their flavors without drying them out as would be the case in a 
        lower heat technique with a longer cooking time.</p>
